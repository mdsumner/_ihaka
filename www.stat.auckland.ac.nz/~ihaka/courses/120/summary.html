    <br>
     
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This course provides an introduction to visualisation techniques
      in statistics.  Using an understanding of graphical perception,
      we will examine graphical displays traditionally used in
      statistics as well as some new ones. We will also look a some
      computer intensive techniques, including animation, as a means
      of gaining insight into data in higher dimensions. Topics will
      consist of a selection taken from the following list.

      Examples will be drawn from across the physical and social
      sciences.

    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>
      The formal prerequisite for the course is a good pass in bursary
      mathematics or one of the other first-year statistics courses. A
      reasonable understanding of basic mathematics (geometry and
      trigonometry) is expected and we will use a tiny amount of
      calculus (differentiating
      <i>x</i><small><sup><big>2</big></sup></small>), but will
      explain this in class. The ability to write clearly is also
      important.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Timetable</h2>
    <p>
      The lectures for the class are at Monday, Wednesday and Friday
      11-12 in Eng3403. The course has a computer laboratory
      scheduled in the Statistics Department's computer tutorial
      room (303.175) on Fridays from noon to 2pm.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Assessment</h2>
    <p>
      The final grade for the course will be made up of 15% from
      assignments, 20% from a mid-semester test, and 65% from the
      final exam. A minimum of 45% must be obtained in the final
      exam. The assignments will require a mix of written exposition
      and graphical presentation. The final exam and test will consist
      of a number of essay questions. The test for the course is
      scheduled for Wednesday August 27, 11am - noon.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Computing</h2>
    <p>
      An important focus of the course is on developing practical
      computing skills and the class will involve a lot of
      computing. This computing can be either be done in the
      Statistics Department's computing laboratory or on your own PC
      at home at home (Windows, Macintosh or Linux).<p>
