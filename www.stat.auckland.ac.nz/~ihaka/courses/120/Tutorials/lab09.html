    <h2>The OpenGL Library</h2>
    
    <p>
      In this lab we'll look at some fancier visualisation techniques.
      In particular we'll take a peek at the use of the Silicon
      Graphics <b>OpenGL</b> graphics library.  OpenGL is standard set
      of graphics utilities which is used in all kinds of
      applications, from scientific visualisation to gaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      In R, the interface to this is through the <b>rgl</b> library.
      You can gain access to rgl with the command
    </p>
    <pre>
library(rgl)
    </pre>
    <p>
      You only need to do this once.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a slight bug in the version of rgl installed in the lab and
      you should "patch" it by pasting the following lines into R.
    </p>
    <pre>
rgl.quads =
function (x, y, z, ...)
{
    rgl.primitive("quadrangles", x, y, z, ...)
}
    </pre>
    <p>
      Once you've done this you are ready to go.
    </p>

    <h2>A First Example</h2>
    
    <p>
      As first example. let's construct a simple 3-d plot.  We'll do
      this with the cherry tree data, which gives the volume of timber
      milled from a tree as a function of its height and girth
      (thickness).
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing we need to do is to load up the data.  It is built
      in to R and we can load it with the command
    </p>
    <pre>
data(trees)
    </pre>
    <p>
      To get a quick 2-d look at data, produce a scatterplot matrix.
    </p>
    <pre>
pairs(trees)
    </pre>
    <p>
      Now let's produce the 3-d plot.  The first step is to scale the
      data so that the units on the x, y, and z axes are comparable.
      You can do this with the command
    </p>
    <pre>
trees = scale(trees)
    </pre>
    <p>
      Now we set up some basic lighting to help us see whats going on.
      We'll place the light 45 degrees to our right (theta) and at an
      elevation of 45 degrees (phi).  We'll also hold the light fixed
      as the points are moved.
    </p>
    <pre>
rgl.clear()
rgl.clear("lights")
rgl.light(theta = 45, phi = 45, viewpoint.rel=TRUE)
    </pre>
    <p>
      These commands should open a small (emplty) graphics window.
      You should be able to resize the window by dragging its lower
      right corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we'll draw small yellow spheres (radius .1) at the locations
      of the data points.  The specular and ambient parameters
      describe how the spheres reflect light.
    </p>
    <pre>
rgl.spheres(trees[,1], trees[,3], trees[,2], r = .1,
            specular = "#FFFFFF",
            ambient = "#222222",
            color="yellow")
    </pre>
    <p>
      You should now see a set of yellow spheres in the graphics window.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should now be able to rotate the points in 3-d by dragging
      on them with the left mouse button pressed.  You will also be
      able to zoom in and out by dragging vertically with the right
      mouse button pressed.  Dragging with the middle mouse button
      pressed will let you vary the amount of perspective usind in the
      plot.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make it easier to orient yourself in the plot we'll add a
      base area to the plot and drop vertical lines from each of the
      points to the base.  You can do this as follows.
    </p>
    <pre>
xlims = range(trees[,1])
ylims = range(trees[,2])
zlims = range(trees[,3])

bot = min(zlims[1]) - diff(zlims)/20

rgl.quads(xlims[c(1,2,2,1)],
          rep(bot, 4),
          ylims[c(1,1,2,2)],
          col = "gray")

for(i in 1:nrow(trees)) {
  rgl.lines(rep(trees[i,1],2),
            c(trees[i,3], bot),
            rep(trees[i,2], 2),
            color = "white")
}
    </pre>
    <p>
      Finally, we'll spin the points by programmatically varying the
      viewpoint.  You can do this as follows.
    </p>
    <pre>
for(i in seq(0, 3 * 360, by = 1)) {
  rgl.viewpoint(theta = i, phi = 0)
}
    </pre>
    <p>
      This rotation should give you some insight into the structure of
      the points in 3-d.  (Try varying the stepsize - e.g. use by=1 -
      and changing the number of revolutions from 3 to some larger or
      smaller value).
    </p>

    <h2>Simple Surface Visualisation</h2>
    <p>
      As a second example of visualisation, we look at a simple
      mathematical function -- in this case f(x,y) = x^2 - y^2.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can define the function and generate its values over an x/y
      grid as follows.
    </p>
    <pre>
f = function(x, y)
{
  (x^2 - y^2)/6
}
                                                                             
x = seq(-3, 3,length = 21)
y = x
z = outer(x, y, f)
    </pre>
    <p>
      To view the surface we again set up the lighting and then use
      the rgl.surface function to display it.  In this case we'll draw
      a smooth version of the surface and superimpose the grid on it.
    </p>
    <pre>
rgl.clear()
rgl.clear("lights")
rgl.light(theta = 0, phi = 90)

rgl.surface(y, x, z, color="seagreen", smooth=TRUE,
            specular = "#444444",
            ambient="#555555",
            front = "fill",
            back = "fill")

rgl.surface(y, x, z + 0.01, color="black", smooth=TRUE,
            specular = "#000000",
            ambient="#555555",
            front = "line")
    </pre>
    <p>
      Again, rotation should you get a better feel for the shape of
      the surface.
    </p>

    <h2>Visualising Terrain</h2>
    <p>
      As a final example, lets look at a digital elevation model of
      Norfolk Island.  This model was built as part of a Master's
      student project to study rainfall on the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can load up the data for the model as follows
    </p>
    <pre>
source("http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/120/Data/ni-smoothed.R")
heights = smoothed
    </pre>
    <p>
      This reads in the island heights over a grid of x/y locations.
      Now we'll plot them as a surface, this time using "realistic"
      terrain colours.  First we set up the lighting
    </p>
    <pre>
rgl.clear()
rgl.clear("lights")
rgl.light(theta=0,phi=45)
    </pre>
    <p>
      Next we set the colours for each "facet" of the grid and
      finally plot the surface.
    </p>
    <pre>
ncolors = 100
colorlut = terrain.colors(ncolors)
colorlut[1] = "steelblue"
xg = seq(xlim[1],xlim[2],length=n)
yg = seq(ylim[1],ylim[2],length=n)
ymax = max(heights)
ymin = min(heights)
col = colorlut[1 + (ncolors - 1) * (heights - ymin)/(ymax - ymin)]

rgl.surface(yg, xg, heights, color=col, smooth=TRUE, specular="#000000")
    </pre>
    <p>
      There is also a data set called ni-unsmoothed.R which defines a
      variable called unsmoothed.  This data set contains the heights
      of the island as read off a contour map.  The smoothed data was
      produced by applying a (stochastic) smoothing technique to the
      unsmoothed heights.
    </p>

    <h2>What You Hand In</h2>
    <p>
      This lab is just intended to show you that advanced visualision
      techniques are really not very scary or hard.  Hopefully, in the
      next couple of years we'll be able to provide free and easy
      access to these (and more) techniques in R.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just hand in a short description of what you did and saw.
