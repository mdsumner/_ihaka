My effort comes in a number of parts which must be loaded into R.
The parts are:

    layout-utilities.R
    dotchart.R
    data.R

Once you've loaded the parts, you can run the examples in

    examples.R

This is just the germ of an idea and is not production code, but
I think that with a little effort it could get cleaned up and
used in practice.
